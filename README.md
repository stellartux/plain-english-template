# Plain English template repo
A template repo for [Plain English](https://osmosianplainenglishprogramming.blog/) projects. You will also need [the CAL-4700](http://www.osmosian.com/cal-4700.zip) to create and compile the code. The language reference and instructions for Plain English are included with the compiler, but [can also be download here](http://www.osmosian.com/instructions.pdf).
